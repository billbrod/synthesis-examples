def setup_metric(metric_name, image, min_ecc, max_ecc, cache_dir,
                 normalize_dict=None, gpu_id=None):
    r"""Setup the metric.

    We initialize the metric, with the specified parameters.

    `metric_name` must either specify a metric (currently: 'ssim' or 'mse') or
    one of our foveated models. If a foveated model, it must be constructed of
    several parts, for which you have several chocies:
    `'{visual_area}{options}_{window_type}_scaling-{scaling}'`:
    - `visual_area`: which visual area we're modeling.`'RGC'` (retinal
      ganglion cells, `plenoptic.simul.PooledRGC` class) or
      `'V1'` (primary visual cortex,
      `plenoptic.simul.PrimaryVisualCortex` class)
    - `options`: you can additionally include the following strs,
      separated by `_`:
      - `'norm'`: if included, we normalize the models' `cone_responses`
        and (if V1) `complex_cell_responses` attributes. In this case,
        `normalize_dict` must also be set (and include those two
        keys). If not included, the model is not normalized
        (normalization makes the optimization easier because the
        different scales of the steerable pyramid have different
        magnitudes).
      - `s#` (V1 only), where `#` is an integer. The number of scales to
        inlude in the steerable pyramid that forms the basis fo the `V1`
        models. If not included, will use 4.
    - `window_type`: `'gaussian'` or `'cosine'`. whether to build the
      model with gaussian or raised-cosine windows. Regardless, scaling
      will always give the ratio between the FWHM and eccentricity of
      the windows, but the gaussian windows are much tighter packed, and
      so require more windows (and thus more memory), but also seem to
      have fewer aliasing issues.
    - `scaling`: float giving the scaling values of these models

    The recommended metric_name values that correspond to our foveated models
    are: `RGC_norm_gaussian_scaling-{scaling}`,
    `V1_norm_s6_gaussian_scaling-{scaling}` (pick whatever scaling value you
    like).

    Parameters
    ----------
    metric_name : str
        str specifying which of the `PooledVentralStream` models we should
        initialize or another metric. See above for more details.
    image : torch.tensor or np.array
        The image we will call the model on. This is only necessary
        because we need to know how big it is; we just use its shape
    min_ecc : float
        The minimum eccentricity for the pooling windows (see
        plenoptic.simul.VentralStream for more details)
    max_ecc : float
        The maximum eccentricity for the pooling windows (see
        plenoptic.simul.VentralStream for more details)
    cache_dir : str or None, optional
        The directory to cache the windows tensor in. If set, we'll look
        there for cached versions of the windows we create, load them if
        they exist and create and cache them if they don't. If None, we
        don't check for or cache the windows.
    normalize_dict : dict or None, optional
        If a dict, should contain the stats to use for normalization. If
        None, we don't normalize. This can only be set (and must be set)
        if the model is "V1_norm". In any other case, we'll throw an
        Exception.
    gpu_id : int or None, optional
        If not None, the GPU we will use. If None, we run on CPU. We
        don't do anything clever to handle that here, but the
        contextmanager utils.get_gpu_id does, so you should use that to
        make sure you're using a GPU that exists and is available (see
        Snakefile for example). Note that, to set this,
        you must set it as a keyword, i.e., ``setup_device(im, 0)``
        won't work but ``setup_device(im, gpu_id=True)`` will (this is
        because the ``*args`` in our function signature will greedily
        grab every non-keyword argument).


    Returns
    -------
    metric : function
        A metric that gives the distance between two images whose pixel values
        lie between 0 and 1.

    is the MSE between the representation of two images.

    If you want to resume synthesis from an earlier run that didn't
    finish, set `continue_path` to the path of the `.pt` file created by
    that earlier run. We will then load it in and continue. For right
    now, we don't do anything to make sure that the arguments you pass
    to the function are the same as the first time, we just use the ones
    passed in. Generally, they should be identical, with the exception
    of learning_rate (which can be None to resume where you left off)
    and max_iter (which gives the number of extra iterations you want to
    do). Specifically, I think things might get weird if you do this
    initially on a GPU and then try to resume on a CPU (or vice versa),
    for example. When resuming, there's always a slight increase in the
    loss that, as far as I can tell, is unavoidable; it goes away
    quickly (and the loss continues its earlier trend) and so I don't
    think is an issue.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fix_metric_name, synthesis_metric_name : str
        str specifying which of the `PooledVentralStream` models we should
        use or another metric. See above for more details.
    image : str or array_like
        Either the path to the file to load in or the loaded-in
        image. If array_like, we assume it's already 2d (i.e.,
        grayscale)
    synthesis_target : {'min', 'max'}
        Whether we're minimizing or maximizing synthesis_metric.
    seed : int, optional
        The number to use for initializing numpy and torch's random
        number generators
    min_ecc : float, optional
        The minimum eccentricity for the pooling windows (see
        plenoptic.simul.VentralStream for more details)
    max_ecc : float, optional
        The maximum eccentricity for the pooling windows (see
        plenoptic.simul.VentralStream for more details)
    learning_rate : float, optional
        The learning rate to pass to optimizer
    max_iter : int, optional
        The maximum number of iterations we allow the synthesis
        optimization to run for
    stop_criterion : float, optional
        The stop criterion. If the loss has changed by less than this over the
        past stop_iters_to_check iterations, we quit out.
    stop_iters_to_check : int, optional
        How many iterations back to check in order to see if the loss has
        stopped decreasing.
    save_path : str or None, optional
        If a str, the path to the file to save the MADCompetition object to. If
        None, we don't save the synthesis output (that's probably a bad idea)
    initial_image : float, optional
        std dev of Gaussian noise added to image to initialize synthesis.
    gpu_id : int or None, optional
        If not None, the GPU we will use. If None, we run on CPU. We
        don't do anything clever to handle that here, but the
        contextmanager utils.get_gpu_id does, so you should use that to
        make sure you're using a GPU that exists and is available (see
        Snakefile for example)
    cache_dir : str or None, optional
        The directory to cache the windows tensor in. If set, we'll look
        there for cached versions of the windows we create, load them if
        they exist and create and cache them if they don't. If None, we
        don't check for or cache the windows.
    fix_metric_normalize_dict, fix_metric_normalize_dict : str or None, optional
        If a str, the path to the dictionary containing the statistics to use
        for normalization for the fix_metric and synthesis_metric models,
        respectively. If None, we don't normalize anything
    optimizer: {'Adam', 'SGD'}
        The choice of optimization algorithm
    metric_tradeoff_lambda :
        Lambda to multiply by ``fixed_metric`` loss and add to
        ``synthesis_metric`` loss. If ``None``, we pick a value so the two
        initial losses are approximately equal in magnitude.
    range_penalty_lambda :
        Lambda to multiply by range penalty and add to loss.
    continue_path : str or None, optional
        If None, we synthesize a new MAD image. If str, this should be the
        path to a previous synthesis run, which we are resuming. In that
        case, you may set learning_rate to None (in which case we resume
        where we left off) and set max_iter to a different value (the
        number of extra iterations to run) otherwise the rest of the
        arguments should be the same as the first run.
    num_threads : int or None, optional
        If int, the number of CPU threads to use. If None, we don't restrict it
        and so we'll use all available resources. If using the GPU, this won't
        matter (all costly computations are done on the GPU). If one the CPU,
        we seem to only improve performance up to ~12 threads (at least with
        RGC model), and actively start to harm performance as we get above 40.
